                    Is coffee healthy?
Black coffee has some noted health benefits, including weight loss, memory improvement, and increased metabolism. However, these health benefits depend on how much coffee is consumed.

How we drink our coffee also influences our health. Unfortunately, many coffee drinks are not healthy because they are consumed with quantities of milk, cream (or ice-cream), sugar, syrups and/or flavourings.

Most of the hand crafted popular coffee drinks made at coffee houses such as Starbucks are loaded with sugar, fat, and caffeine.

However, Starbucks do make it possible for the health conscious to modify their drinks and avoid dairy products and sugar.

Caffeine should always be consumed in moderation. Although it is a legal and ‘safe’ drug, it’s strongly recommended that we don’t consume more than 400mg per day.
